# First Memo (Deliverable Three)
To this point, we’ve been working through all the datasets we’ve been provided, trying to clean through them and find notable PPP loans to senators’ companies/assets. We’re aiming to clean and standardize the names of companies/assets in the datasets so that we can join those datasets to the main PPP loan dataset. From there, we can look through the PPP loans connected to senators and see if any loans stick out for any reason. 

So far, we’ve been able to pull out one particularly interesting loan connected to Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo. Using the PPP loan dataset, the dataset listing senators’ assets, and online research. There was a loan of around $2,000 provided to Crapo Estate Holdings, LLC in Utah. Notably, the address of this company (as listed on the PPP dataset) is actually a residential address, and Mike Crapo’s wife, Susan Crapo, was listed online as being linked to this address. We couldn’t find any firm evidence of anything wrong in this case, and the loan amount was relatively small, but it still raised questions as to the purpose of this loan. 

Moving forward, we’re looking to expand the scope of our search. To this point, we focused on businesses described as LLCs, but we’re planning on identifying businesses under other descriptions, as well. For now though, we’re trying to find the best way to clean the names of the businesses so that we can easily join the datasets together.
